# MB-VQE
[meta-MERA](.%2Fmeta-MERA.ipynb) is one of the meta-VQE algorithms, taking MERA as the exact form of VQE. I take 1D TFIM as the example Hamiltonian (J=1.0, Bx is changeable, Bz=0.0).  
In comparison, I uploaded [meta-QCNN](.%2Fmeta-QCNN.ipynb), which has a reversed processing circuit layer.  
You can see the results in the figure below (8 qubits).
